## Introduction

If you're into open-source, there's some chance you've already heard the term musl.
[Musl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musl) is an implementation of the
[C standard library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library), just like the
GNU C Library ([glibc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glibc)) or the [BSD libc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_standard_library#BSD_libc).

For all Linux distros, the C standard library is extremely important. That's because
the foundations of all Linux-based operating systems are written in C. C is unarguably the
programming language of open-source and that won't change for a long time. Most common libraries
and basic tools are written in C.

If you're a programmer, you know that it's hard to do anything without libraries.
Your language's standard library is the bare minimum, unless you're developing a kernel
or a kernel driver - the kernel is a freestanding environment, it doesn't have access
to any libraries.

But things like `printf` from `<stdio.h>` don't work just because the language documentation says so.
Someone had to implement that functionality, often on the low-level. For example,
you can't print annything to the console without making a system call,
that is - requesting a "service" from the kernel.

For programs written in C, this is where the C standard library comes in.
Most Linux distros ship with glibc, the GNU's implementation. Unfortunately,
glibc is not perfect - it's rather bloated, which is a big issue for embedded devices,
Also, it doesn't stricly adhere to standards, which means that programs written with
glibc in mind often won't work with other libc implementations.

That's why many open-source enthusiasts are interested in musl,
a general-purpose C standard library that seeks to address these issues.
It's not the only alternative libc implementation for Linux,
there's also [uClibc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UClibc),
but uClibc is intended for embedded systems, that's why it's not the main
topic of the article.

So, musl sounds good, but can I use it on my desktop?
To answer this question, I'll spin-up some VMs and check out some
of the most popular distros which support musl.

## Void

I've heard about Void before, but I've never tried it myself.
Void users say that it's lightweight, configurable, and surprisingly
reliable for a rolling distro. Are they right? Let's seeâ€¦

### Installation

The installation was rather straighforward. First, I had to
to launch `void-installer` from the terminal. Then,
I had to do some basic configuration. I have to admit that
it wasn't the most intuitive installer I've used, but it did the job.

The installer surprised me positively with its speed.
After configuring everything, the installation itself
took just about one minute.

### General experience

Void felt snappy and there were no serious bugs.
The distro is generally well-documented, the software
repositories contain everything I needed, and there's
a small, but helpful Void community online. Overall,
I was pretty happy with Void.

### Software compatibility

###### Desktop environment

I chose GNOME as my desktop environment. I love
GNOME, I've been using it for many years, so I was
happy to see that it's available and compatible with musl.

It worked fine, just like all preinstalled apps I tried,
except for one called 'Music'. The music player just crashes
immediately.

###### VS Code, Julia

Installing both was easy and they worked well.
I was able to write and execute Julia code
without any problems.

###### Chromium

Ah, (almost) everyone's favorite web browser.
I was able to install it and watch some YouTube videos.
I think it works fine.

###### Steam

What about gaming? Can I install Steam without any issues?

Well, kinda. Because Valve doesn't compile Steam for musl,
it can't run natively. You can make a glibc chroot by yourself or
just use Flatpak.

I decided to use Flatpak since it's easier. Steam worked fine,
no additional configuration was needed. I was able to launch
Nekopara with Proton.

###### PassMark's PerformanceTest

Sometimes you need to benchmark your computer.
Could I use PassMark for it when running Void using musl?

Yes, I could, but not without a glibc chroot. When using musl,
all I could see in the terminal was a cryptic
`no such file or directory` error. After installing
`gcompat`, which is supposed to be a compatibility layer between
musl and glibc, the error message became `segmentation fault`.

Void chroot also didn't work, because it uses ncurses 6,
while PerformanceTest needs ncurses 5. I couldn't find
ncurses 5 in Void repos. That's why I decided to use
a Debian chroot, as Debian provides an ncurses 5 package.

It worked. I was able to benchmark my system without
any issues. All that was needed was a chroot.

###### Contract Demon

A heartwarming visual novel created by [NomnomNami](https://nomnomnami.itch.io/contract-demon).
It's about a demon and an angel who love each other. Contract Demon
uses Ren'Py, which is written in Python, so I should be able to run
it just fine, right?

Not exactly. It comes with some native libraries, which are, obviously,
linked against glibc. I could try compiling these libraries for musl,
but that wasn't necessary - my novel about demons and angels worked
just fine with `gcompat` installed.

## Other distros

Void is not the only distribution which supports
musl. There are other distros, like Alpine, based on
musl by default, and Gentoo, which provides a musl
flavor. However, I don't think than trying them
is important - musl compatibility issues would
be exactly the same, as it's not a distribution itself
that causes these incompatibilities, but the libc
implementation used.

## Conclusions

If you're feeling adventurous, you certainly can check
out a distro using musl as its libc implementation.
The system itself will work completely fine, except for
Nvidia drivers, which won't work with musl, so keep that
in mind if you have an Nvidia card. This can change in
the near future, though, as Nvidia has recently open-sourced
their Linux drivers.

When it comes to software compatibility, it's also acceptable.
Most open-source software will work, as the distro maintainers
can compile it against musl, patching when necessary. Precompiled
binaries will often work with `gcompat`, but sometimes, they'll need
a complete glibc chroot. Using Flatpaks also works - they come with
their own set of libraries, including glibc.

Okay, but should you use musl, though? It's highly subjective.
If you dislike glibc for some reason, think it's broken, care about adherence
to standards, etc., then musl might be for you. If all you want is a working
system, with no hassle related to dealing with incompatibilities, you better
stick to glibc.
