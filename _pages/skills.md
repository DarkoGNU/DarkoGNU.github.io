As an open-source enthusiast, I've worked with multiple technologies and programming languages.

These are my strongest skills:

- [GNU/Linux administration](#gnulinux-administration)
- [Game server configuration and management](#game-server-configuration-and-management)
- [C++](#c)
- [Git](#git)
- [Translation between Polish and English](#translation-between-polish-and-english)
- [Basic front-end](#basic-front-end)

## GNU/Linux administration

I switched from Windows to GNU/Linux as my main operating system a few years ago, and I'm not looking back.
I'm familiar with multiple distributions, including Fedora, Debian, Arch, Gentoo, and OpenWrt.

[OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) is a particularly interesting one - I use it on my network devices.
To update my home router and WiFi APs quickly, I've written [openwrt-build-script](https://github.com/DarkoGNU/openwrt-build-script).
It makes updating my routers as simple as generating the images and flashing them. That's it - even my SSH keys are included!

I'm experienced with hosting game servers, VOIP servers (like TeamSpeak), databases, and websites.
I use Docker or Podman when it's possible, always with Docker Compose.

## Game server configuration and management

Among my friends, I'm always the guy who will set up a game server, configure it, and install some plugins.
It always goes in pair with GNU/Linux administration, as I'm not fond of dedicated game hosting.
I prefer to buy a VPS, SSH into it, and configure everything manually. I like to be in full control.

I'm experienced with hosting these games: Minecraft, Terraria, ARK: Survival Evolved, Assetto Corsa,
and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

## C++

This is the language I used for my [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language))
language interpreter, [SimpleLogo](https://github.com/DarkoGNU/SimpleLogo). It interprets simple scripts that
describe a turtle's path. With simple recursion and a few lines of code, beautiful images are generated.

SimpleLogo is one of my most algorithmically advanced projects, as interpreting a language that supports recursion isn't an easy task,
even when it's a very simple programming language.

I'm also a contributor to [Cuberite](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite), an open-source Minecraft server.

## Git

That's a natural one for someone who's into open-source. I prefer working with Git in the command line instead of using a GUI.

I'm not a Git Guru, but committing, working with branches, merging - that's everyday stuff for me.

## Translation between Polish and English

I'm capable of creating bilingual content. I usually write stuff in English first, then I translate it into Polish.
The reason - translating something into your native language is always easier than the other way around.

I can, of course, translate English to Polish, too. The result won't be perfect, just like my English isn't at a native level yet.
But it will usually be good enough :)

## Basic front-end

If I can make a simple website, I think I'm allowed to say that I know how to do some basic front-end stuff.

That's nothing fancy, of course. DarkoGNU.eu uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static website generator,
and a theme called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mademistakes.com/work/minimal-mistakes-jekyll-theme/).

I've tried some more advanced stuff with [waifu2x_flutter](https://github.com/DarkoGNU/waifu2x_flutter), an Android app.
It's unfinished mainly because ofâ€¦ back-end difficulties. But I'm sure I'll finish waifu2x_flutter one day!
