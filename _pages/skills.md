As an open-source enthusiast, I've worked with multiple technologies and programming languages.

These are my strongest skills:

## GNU/Linux administration

I've switched from Windows to GNU/Linux as my main operating system a few years ago and I'm not looking back.
I'm familiar with multiple distributions, including Fedora, Debian, Arch, Gentoo and OpenWrt.

OpenWrt is a particularly interesting one - I use it on my network devices.
To update my home router and WiFi APs quickly, I've written [openwrt-build-script](https://github.com/DarkoGNU/openwrt-build-script).
It makes updating my routers as simple as generating the images and flashing them. That's it - even my SSH keys are included!

I'm experienced with hosting game servers, VOIP servers (like TeamSpeak), databases, and websites.

## Game server configuration and management

Among my friends, I'm always the guy who will set up a game server, configure it and install some plugins.
It always goes in pair with GNU/Linux administration, as I'm not fond of dedicated game hosting.
I prefer to buy a VPS, SSH into it and configure everything manually. I like to be in full control.

I'm experienced with hosting these games: Minecraft, Terraria, ARK: Survival Evolved, Assetto Corsa,
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.

## C++

This is the language I've used for my Logo language interpreter, [SimpleLogo](https://github.com/DarkoGNU/SimpleLogo).
It interpretes simple scripts and generates imagery. With simple recursion and a few lines of code, beautiful images are generated.

SimpleLogo is one of my most algorithmically advanced projects, as interpreting a language that supports recursion isn't an easy task,
even if it's a very simple programming language.

I'm also a contributor to [Cuberite](https://github.com/cuberite/cuberite), an open-source Minecraft server.

## Git

That's a natural one for someone who's into open-source. I prefer working with Git in the command line instead of using a GUI.

I'm not a Git Guru, but committing, working with branches and merging - that's everyday stuff for me.

## Translation between Polish and English

Creating bilingual content is not an issue for me. I usually write stuff in English first, then I translate it into Polish.
The reason - translating something into your native language is always easier than the other way around.

I can, of course, translate English into Polish, too. The result won't be perfect, just like my English isn't quite native level yet.
But it will usually be good enough :)

## Basic front-end

If I can make a simple website, I think I'm allowed to say that I know how to do some basic front-end stuff :)

This is nothing fancy, of course. DarkoGNU.eu uses Jekyll, a static website generator, and a theme called Minimal Mistakes.
I've tried some more advanced stuff with (waifu2x_flutter)[https://github.com/DarkoGNU/waifu2x_flutter], an Android app.
It's unfinished mainly because of... back end difficulties. But I'm sure I'll finish waifu2x_flutter one day!
