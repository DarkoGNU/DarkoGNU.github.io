## Phonology and phonetics

Well, that's quite a weird one, right?
I'm fairly knowledgeable about the pronunciation of the following languages:

- English
- Polish
- Spanish
- Japanese

I'm the best at English phonology. I'm always eager to learn about stuff like
vowel mergers, cluster reductions, flapping, and other phonological processes.

When it comes to Spanish and Japanese, I don't even speak those
languages (I'm learning Japanese, though). That doesn't stop me from knowing what are
the phonemes of them, how does the Japanese pitch accent work, and what are
the differences in pronunciation between different dialects.

Also, knowing the intrinsics of Polish phonology allows me to understand memes and jokes
that play either on Polish dialects or the differences between spelling and pronunciation.

## Image editing

I'm far from being a professional photo editor or a digital artist, but I know some
basic stuff. For example, I designed this e&#8209;liquid label. I'm really proud of my work!

Just like your average AliExpress seller, I didn't ask for permission to use these anime girls.
If you're a copyright holder of those images, you can send me an e&#8209;mail and I'll take down my work.
The girls are [Jahy&#8209;sama](https://twitter.com/aconbwakame/status/1113036854201204736) and
[Ayanami](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/78790389).

## Writing

I guess that I'm quite talented when it comes to writing. I've been praised for my essays since the elementary school,
even though I have never been trying particulatry hard - it just comes naturally.
Also, when my colleagues need help with some tech&#8209;related stuff,
I'm happy to write a quick tutorial in Markdown and upload it to GitHub Gist.

Now, while creating my personal website, I'm rediscovering my passion for writing.

## Music

I love the underground. There's nothing wrong with mainstream music, of course, but
I believe that everyone should discover some underrated artists and check out less popular genres.

My own playlists consist mostly of EDM tunes, with some occasional rock, rap, or even classical pieces.

Here are some of my all-time favorites:

##### Ganja White Night - Trinity

You can check out my playlist [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPa9qwFC6sQucfaqDZ1zvwW9LU7vqosNi).
There's no Spotify version, unfortunately. YouTube is the best streaming platform for underground music fans,
because a lot of unpopular songs just aren't available on Spotify!

Also, you can easily upload a song to YouTube yourself. For example, I had to upload
[Nurkalyi - ZaberZ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSMv8wO-NeI), as no one has done it before me.
