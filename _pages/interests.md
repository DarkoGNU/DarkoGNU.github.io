## Phonology and phonetics

Well, that's quite a weird one, right?
I'm fairly knowledgeable about the pronunciation of the following languages:

- English
- Polish
- Spanish
- Japanese

I'm the best at English phonology. I'm always eager to learn about stuff like
vowel mergers, cluster reductions, flapping, and other phonological processes.

When it comes to Spanish and Japanese, I don't even speak these
languages (I'm learning Japanese, though). That doesn't stop me from knowing what are
the phonemes of these languages, how does the Japanese pitch accent work, and what are
the differences in pronunciation between different dialects.

Also, knowing the intrinsics of Polish phonology allows me to understand memes and jokes
that play on Polish dialects or the differences between spelling and pronunciation.

## Image editing

I'm far from being a professional photo editor or a digital artist, but I know some
basic stuff. For example, I've designed this e&#8209;liquid label. I'm really proud of my work!

Just like your average AliExpress seller, I didn't ask for permission to use these anime girls.
If you're an artist, you can send me an e&#8209;mail and I'll take down my work.
The girls are [Jahy&#8209;sama](https://twitter.com/aconbwakame/status/1113036854201204736) and
[Ayanami](https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/78790389).
